        <h2>Welcome to my JavaScript Project Portfolio</h2>
        <br>

        <p> <img id="java" src="assets/javaguy.jpg" alt="java person">Thanks for taking a look at my first JavaScript
            projects. These were done while I was a student in the
            Persevere boot camp class.<br><br>If you want to check out the html and css that I employed, just use the
            inspector tool on Chrome. There is a lot of duplicate css in this project, and the reason is that multiple
            projects were assembled together and I wanted each html page to have a unique css that could be transferred
            elsewhere if need be. That aside, I hope you find things neat and in order in terms of presentation. The
            JavaScript is locked in a safe that requires ethically sourced tiger teeth to
            open, so good luck with that.<br><br>The projects were challenging, fun, and super rewarding. I feel lucky
            to have discovered coding, albeit late in life. It is a constant process of reframing problems and searching
            for solutions. I believe the disciplines required in coding will serve me both professionally and personally
            and look forward to sharpening my skills further.</p>
